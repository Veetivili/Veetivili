- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Veetivili. I'm studying bachelor degree in ICT-engineering at JAMK.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software developing, loving both front-, and backend.
- ðŸŒ± Do you have some project in mind? I'd like to work with you!
- I'm more used to GitLab but I'm starting to use GitHub for my hobby projects.
